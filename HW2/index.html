                    <h2>Points to remember</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Rinse the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear, then soak roughly two parts rice to three parts cold water in a saucepan for 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Next, bring the rice to the boil, cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the rice has absorbed all the water and is tender. Check the packet instructions for exact timings.</li>
                        <li>Stir through the rice vinegar and sugar, it's easier to mix these before as the sugar will dissolve.</li>
                        <li>Cool the rice down as quickly as you can by spreading it onto a baking tray and covering with a slightly damp tea towel.</li>
                        <li>Place a nori sheet on top of your sushi rolling mat.</li>
                        <li>Dampen your hands to prevent sticking, then pick up a handful of rice and spread evenly on your nori sheet, leaving the top third uncovered.</li>
                        <li>Place a thin row of filling ingredients across the middle of the rice.</li>
                        <li>Hold the near edge of the mat, lift and roll away from you, encasing the filling. Ensure the ingredients stay in place and the rice sticks.</li>
                        <li>Dampen the top boarder with a little water to seal. Wrap tightly in cling film and chill until firm.</li>
                        <li>Brush your knife with rice vinegar to prevent sticking and cut the roll into neat rounds.</li>
                        <li>Serve with pickled ginger and a dollop of wasabi.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>What seaweed should you use for sushi recipes?</h2>
                    <p>To get started, you need the right kind of seaweed. The one on the left below is thick and perfect for rolling (this is the one I use). The one on the right is too flimsy. I use that seaweed for snacking. Make sure you get seaweed specific for making sushi, which it should state on the package. It will sometimes say “nori” on the package. If the seaweed you’ve bought seems to have one side that’s shinier than the other, have the shiny side facing the rolling surface so that it’s on the outside of the roll.
                    Then spread your sheet of nori with a layer of prepared sushi rice (that whole post covers how to make the rice), and flatten the top of the rice gently with a paddle, but do not smash the rice, as my mom would always say. And make sure not to neglect the edges of the nori sheet! I cover details in-depth in that post, but I recommend a short-grain rice, as well as a white rice, instead of brown. Long-grain rice is usually not sticky rice, and that is an important factor for helping hold the rolls shut. 
                    I also season the rice with a sushi vinegar that has a touch of salt and sugar in it. You may also add sesame seeds, if you wish. Also know that the rice will be easiest to spread when it’s slightly warm or at room temperature, so prepare the timing right in advance for when you want to eat. For my rolls this time, I got this gorgeous piece of salmon. It was a 1/2lb piece, and gave us enough fish for about 6 rolls, plus some snacking. Even at $28/lb, which seems like a lot, paying $14 for that much fish 
                    is certainly worth it, and dirt cheap if you ask me! Here is how I cut salmon for my sushi rolls. First, cut straight down through the filet, then cut that piece in half through the center so you have a small strip. Make sure you’re using a sharp knife and gliding with one stroke, to get a nice clean cut. Place your desired ingredients onto the sushi rice. I’ve got salmon, avocado, and cream cheese (I know, I know. But Philly-style rolls are my favorite, and making this at home is all about customizing 
                    the ingredients to what you enjoy) Roll it up tightly, using a bamboo mat. It’s a specific kitchen item, but you can get a decent one for less than $2 on Amazon or at an Asian market, so I think it’s worth having. It ensures the best results for the roll holding together. If you don’t have one, you can sort of use parchment paper or plastic wrap, but you won’t be able to wrap it as tightly, so buy one if you plan to make sushi regularly. Then use your sharpest knife to cut the sushi salmon roll into pieces.
                    I don’t find it particularly better to use a serrated knife. Just make sure to use a sharp one! You may also wish to have a small bowl of cold water or a damp towel at your work station for wiping your fingertips between rolls. Sometimes things can get sticky, so this can really make things easier! Now you’re ready to eat the sushi rolls with some soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi paste, as desired!</p>
